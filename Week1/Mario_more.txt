1) Mario More.

Mario More is the 1st problem of set 1 from Week 1.
The problem is to create a program that can create "Mario ladders" as I call them, to an input height.
Mario Ladders that is:-
    #  #
   ##  ##
  ###  ###
 ####  ####
#####  #####   [This is to an input height of 5]
The solution is mostly used for loops and functions.

2) Credit.

Credit is the 2nd problem of the Pset1 from Week 1.
The problem is to create an algorithm that can "validate" and "Name" the credit card numbers given.
My code is about 120 lines and uses Luhn's algorithm (as prompted).
You can run it after a little of compiling!
