Mario more is the 1st problem of Pset 1 from Week 1.
The problem is to create a program that can create "Mario ladders" as I call them, to an input height.
Mario Ladders that is :- 
    #  #
   ##  ##
  ###  ###
 ####  ####
#####  #####   [This is to an input height of 5]
The solution mostly uses for loops and functions.
