    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hey there, I am Harshit Mukhedkar, I am 17 as of 2024 and I am from India.
        <br>I had a pretty eventful and happening childhood. Being in India I had extreme <br>
        influence of art and culture as well as the diverse film industry we have in India. <br>
        Now talking about my hobbies and skills, as I said I had a happening childhood <br>
        and that helped me create and learn new hobbies and skills.<br>
        I could already code in Python, Java and C. Now through CS50 I learnt SQL and HTML.
        After learning 6 computer languages I still feel like computer science or programming<br>
        is not something that I wanted to do as a young and curious child. <br>
        I always wanted to go in arts, create stuff that would create an impact,<br>
        not only me but the whole of humanity.<br> 
        But as it happens with all of us I just couldn't go for the dream!
        But now I have the ambition to create the impact through the things I know.
